    <string name="description_string">Supernova remnant W44 is the focus of this new image 
        created by combining data from the European Space Agency\'s Herschel and XMM-Newton space observatories.    
        W44 is the vast purple sphere that dominates the left hand side of this image, and measures about 100 light-years
         across. XMM-Newton data reveal that the remnant is filled with X-ray emission from extremely hot gas.Herschel\'s 
         three-colour infrared view comprises PACS 70 and 160 micron and SPIRE 250 micron images. X-ray data from 
         XMM-Newton\'s EPIC instrument for W44 only has been added in light and dark blue to represent 
          and low-energy X-ray emission, respectively. The field of view is about one degree across. North is 
          towards the bottom left of the image; east is to the top right.</string>
